# AUTOMATED-EXPENSE-TRACKER
The Automated Expense Tracker App, built with Flutter and Dart, helps users manage personal finances. It allows manual expense input, visualizes spending through graphs, and uses OCR to scan bills and SMS parsing for automatic tracking. Completed as a third-year college mini project, it provides a strong foundation for future enhancements.
